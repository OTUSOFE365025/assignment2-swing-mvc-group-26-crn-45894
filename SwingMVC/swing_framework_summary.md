# Java Swing Framework Summary

Java Swing is a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit for Java. It provides a set of 'lightweight' (platform-independent) components for building rich desktop applications. Swing is part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) and offers a wide range of widgets such as buttons, text fields, tables, and more. It supports pluggable look-and-feel, MVC architecture for components, and event-driven programming. Swing components are written entirely in Java, making them portable across platforms, and they are rendered using Java's painting APIs rather than relying on native OS widgets.

## Key Features
- Platform independence
- Rich set of GUI components
- Pluggable look-and-feel
- Event-driven programming model
- MVC-based component architecture

```

- `JComponent` is the base class for all Swing components.
- `JFrame` is the top-level window.
- `JPanel` is a container for organizing components.
- `JButton`, `JLabel`, `JTextField`, etc., are common UI widgets.
