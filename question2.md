# MVC Pattern in the Provided Example

## How the Example Implements MVC

The provided codebase follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern as follows:

- **Model (`Model.java`)**: Holds the application's data (first name and last name) and provides getter and setter methods to access and modify this data.
- **View (`View.java`)**: Responsible for the graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. It creates and arranges UI components (labels, text fields, buttons) and exposes them via getter methods for use by the controller.
- **Controller (`Controller.java`)**: Acts as the intermediary between the Model and the View. It initializes the view with data from the model, listens for user actions (button clicks), updates the model based on user input, and provides feedback to the user (e.g., via dialog boxes).

## Differences from Conventional MVC

- **Direct Access to View Components**: The controller directly accesses and manipulates Swing components in the view (e.g., text fields and buttons) via getter methods. In a strict MVC, the view would notify the controller of user actions via events, and the controller would update the model, with the view observing model changes.
- **No Observer Pattern**: The model does not notify the view of changes. Instead, the controller is responsible for updating both the model and the view. In a conventional MVC, the view would observe the model and update itself automatically when the model changes.
- **Tight Coupling**: The controller is tightly coupled to both the model and the view, which is common in many Swing-based MVC implementations but differs from the more decoupled approach described in lectures.

## Summary

This implementation is typical of Java Swing applications, where the controller manages both user input and updates to the view and model. It is less decoupled than the classical MVC pattern, but it is practical for small to medium-sized desktop applications.
